# aliceostberg
educational purpose, trying to make my own website

The Brief for week 2 was:

- Create a HTML page 
  
I have created several :)    

  
- Create a javascript array or object
- Create some javascrivt that will display the information in the HTML 

Check the side "Professional", under the headline My Interestts, I created an array (in js) with my interest and transferred the data       to HTML and it works :) :) 
  
  
- Make it available so you can share a link to it
